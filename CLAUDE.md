# Project Context

## About This Project
- **Learning project** - TypeScript developer learning C++ for audio software/plugin development
- Main goal is education and understanding, not just getting things working

## Working Style
- **DO NOT update files unless explicitly requested** - this is a learning project and automatic fixes defeat the purpose
- Offer suggestions, explanations, and guidance instead of making changes
- Exception: Documentation and reference materials can be created/updated when asked

## Documentation Style
Reference docs in `docs/cpp-reference/` should be:
- **Concise and to the point** - no excessive filler
- **Scannable** - clear sections, code examples, key takeaways
- **Practical** - focus on "aha moments" and common gotchas
- If it's too long or wordy, it won't get read!
